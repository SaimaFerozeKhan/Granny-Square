# Granny-Square
. Granny squares are a classic crochet pattern, often featuring vibrant colors and versatile designs. These small, square motifs are typically made using a series of basic stitches like chains, double crochets, and slip stitches, and they can be combined to create a wide variety of projects such as blankets, pillows, bags, and even clothing.
